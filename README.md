Project 2

March 14, 2024 

This project was done by Nicole Anderson and Ryan MacFarlane - the notebook portions were done using Visual Studio Code.  All code was written by the two of us - however, help and guidance was given from both the Canvas Learning Assistant, as well as ChatGPT.

If you have any trouble accessing the repository - please don't hesitate to reach out to me at atlis34@yahoo.com.

Thank you for reading/grading!
